Sa limitadong mga laban sa overs, ang mga taya ay mawawalan ng bisa kung hindi naging posible na kumpletuhin ang hindi bababa sa 80% ng mga naka-iskedyul na overs sa mga nauugnay na inning dahil sa panlabas na mga kadahilanan, kabilang ang masamang panahon, maliban kung ang kasunduan ay natukoy. Sa mga iginuhit na laban sa Unang Klase, mawawalan ng bisa ang mga taya kung wala pang 200 overs ang na-bow, maliban kung kumpleto ang bowling innings ng manlalaro. Ang resulta ay isasaalang-alang na tinutukoy kung ang linya kung saan ang taya ay naipasa. Sa First Class na mga laro, mga first innings wicket lang ang bibilangin at tatakbo. Hindi mabibilang ang mga wicket at run na naitala sa super over.',
